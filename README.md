## 🚀 Key Features and Showcase

* **Batch EXIF Extraction:** Process hundreds of `.jpg` or `.jpeg` files simultaneously to pull deep metadata.
* **Geospatial Visualization:** Automatically plot GPS coordinates onto interactive maps for immediate situational awareness.
* **Timeline Reconstruction:** Generate a chronological flow of events based on image timestamps to track movement or verify alibis.
* **Privacy-First OSINT:** Run locally on your machine—no data is ever uploaded to external servers.
* **Lightweight & Fast:** Optimized for rapid analysis without heavy resource consumption.
